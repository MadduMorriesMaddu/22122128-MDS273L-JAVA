You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
1.Enter a name
2.Search for a name
3.Remove a name
4.Show all names
This menu-driven program is made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.

Conditions:
The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
Format your results properly!!
